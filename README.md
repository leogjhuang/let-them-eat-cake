# Let Them Eat Cake

## Description and end product
The proposed tycoon game for this final project is titled LET THEM EAT CAKE. The purpose of this coding project is to have produced a design which will give players a fun opportunity and a reason to play again. This adventure revolves around the idea of gathering resources to an extent which allows you to both survive and leave the game with a slice of cake. Admittedly, this game is centered around the life of a French peasant during the 17th century, although not explicitly mentioned. The title is a reference to the infamous quote, supposedly said by Queen Marie Antoinette in a time of widespread bread shortages and revolution. At the beginning of the game, the player is mostly unaware of the gameâ€™s function, with the importance of energy being the sole thing revealed. The player is instructed that they have an energy bar, and a main goal is to not let their energy drop to 0.
